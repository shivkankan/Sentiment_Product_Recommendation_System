# Sentiment Based Product Recommendation

A comprehensive machine learning project that analyzes product reviews and predicts sentiment (Positive, Neutral, or Negative) using various ML algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project implements a complete sentiment analysis pipeline including:
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Advanced text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, spell correction)
- Multiple feature extraction techniques (BoW, TF-IDF)
- Training and comparison of 4 ML models
- Model evaluation and selection

The script will:
1. Load and clean the data
2. Preprocess the text
3. Extract features using TF-IDF
4. Train 4 ML models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, XGBoost)
5. Evaluate and compare all models
6. Save the best model and generate visualizations
